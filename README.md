FA Test

## run

`npm run start`

## Requiremets to build

- node
- typescript
- ts-node for development

## build

`npm run build`

## Notes

#### What I will do better?:

Change callbacks in TS to promises. Something I found initially challenging to make it work with node readline module due to is lack of docs at the official site. I decided to move on for the progress of delivery.
